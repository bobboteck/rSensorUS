rSensorUS
=========

rSensorUS is a board for control up to 8 HC-SR04 Ultrasonic ranging modules based on Microchip PIC 18F2620.

The board have two analog input and one I2C master port, theoretically will be used to connect a temperature and humidity sensors, with the purpose of compensate the measurements of the ultrasonic sensors.

the communication with master controller can take place via serial TTL or RS-485.

The power voltage is 5 Volt.
